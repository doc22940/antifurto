TODO LIST
---------

* Kill subprocess
  - used to kill notification processes
* Optimizations
  - current bottleneks are cv::MatConstIterator::operator++() and
    countMotionPixels()
* Delete CameraController when it is not needed (i.e. no monitor nor live view)
* Web server
  - add start stop monitor
  - add live view
- In Picture.hpp use an std::vector<unsigned char> instead of cv::Mat;
  provide conversion operators to InputArray and OutputArray
- Packaging system
- Archive refactor
  - Pack old directories in videos
  - Sync dropbox with archive directories
  - Put not uploaded images in a list and serve it when alarm is off
- Service registration with start and stop
- Radio controller
- Bootstrap script for cross compile
- Add cmake configurations for profile and distribution
  see: CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES in
  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables
- Refactor of CameraController
  - Port CameraController to use TaskScheduler
    to do this, a cancellation token for a Task is needed
  - the setPeriod should take the Registration as parameter, so the period
    becomes the min of all the periods
- Use two TaskScheduler
  - one only for the pictures cycle
  - one for all the long running tasks
