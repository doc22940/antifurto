* Reboot on crash
  - use linux whatchdog daemon
  - save persistently the last status and restore it (monitoring on/off)
* Kill subprocess
  - used to kill notification processes
* Optimizations
  - current bottleneks are cv::MatConstIterator::operator++() and
    countMotionPixels()
* Web server
  - refactor live view to use sockets instead of fifo
  - add query to monitor status (posix message queue? socket? pipe?)
* Bug fix
  - in RecordingController::initUploader(), if no connection is available, the

        mmal: mmal_port_enable: failed to enable port
        vc.ril.camera:out:1(I420)(0xb17044a0) (ENOSPC)
        mmal: camera video callback2 error
        mmal: raspiCamCvCreateCameraCapture: Failed to create camera component
    the problem is that the shutdown of the camera is not right

- In Picture.hpp use an std::vector<unsigned char> instead of cv::Mat;
  provide conversion operators to InputArray and OutputArray
- Packaging system
- Archive refactor
  - Pack old directories in videos
  - Sync dropbox with archive directories
- Service registration with start and stop
- Radio controller
- Bootstrap script for cross compile
- Add cmake configurations for profile and distribution
  see: CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES in
  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables
- Refactor of CameraController
  - Port CameraController to use TaskScheduler
    to do this, a cancellation token for a Task is needed
- Use two TaskScheduler
  - one only for the pictures cycle
  - one for all the long running tasks
- Display logs in webserver
